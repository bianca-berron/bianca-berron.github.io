title: "Surfing!"
---

Growing up in San Diego, I learned to surf at a young age. Being out in the water is unlike anything else, and is one of my outlets from school. There is something incredibly special about being in the ocean and riding waves. I'm very grateful to have grown up where I did.

I've also been lucky to have my surfing photographed by my sister, Erika. She takes photos of my dad, brother, and I which I am so thankful for.
