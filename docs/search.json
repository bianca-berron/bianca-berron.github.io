There is something incredibly special about being in the ocean and riding waves. I’m very grateful to have grown up where I did.\n\nI’ve also been lucky to have my surfing photographed by my sister, Erika. She takes photos of my dad, brother, and I which I am so thankful for.\n\nBelow is a collage of some of my most favorite surf photos:\n\n\n\nAll of these photos are taken at Beacons Beach, my homebreak."

Below are some of the data visualizations I have created in chronological order, from the first visualization I created to my most recent.\n\n\n\nThis was the first visualization I ever created for my first homework assignment to show annual sea level rise. 4/17/2023\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this figure, I learned how to use the facet_wrap function to break up a plot into different panels. 4/25/2023\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure is my most recent data visualization and portrays how ice duration of lakes is decreasing over time. 5/14/2023"
