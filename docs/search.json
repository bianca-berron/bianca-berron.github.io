Below are some of the data visualizations I have created in chronological order, from the first visualization I created to my most recent.\n\n\n\nThis was the first visualization I ever created for my first homework assignment to show annual sea level rise. 4/17/2023\n\n\n\n\n\nFor this figure, I learned how to use the facet_wrap function to break up a plot into different panels. 4/25/2023\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure is my most recent data visualization and portrays how ice duration of lakes is decreasing over time. 5/14/2023"
